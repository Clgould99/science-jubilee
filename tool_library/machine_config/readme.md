# Example machine configuration files

`color_mix_configs` contains configuration files pulled from a system that was used to run the color mix demonstration with an OT2 pipette and webcamera V3. These configs use the `toffsets.g` tool offsets method, in which tool offsets live in a separate file. This allows you to adjust them without having to re-home the machine with each tweak. Simply run `M98 P"toffsets.g" after updating values to load them.
