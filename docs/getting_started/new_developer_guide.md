title: Getting Started as a New Jubilee Developer
---

This page provides a general overview of the Jubilee ecosystem with an eye towards getting a new contributor up to speed as a developer of Jubilee for science. This guide was developed as a resource to aid in the onboarding of new students in the Pozzo research group, but can serve as a useful reference for anyone new to Jubilee.

## What is Jubilee?

To lift directly from the Jubilee wiki, ["Jubilee is an extensible multi-tool motion platform capable of running G-code for low force automation applications."](https://jubilee3d.com/index.php?title=Main_Page). Jubilee is originally developed and configured as a tool-changing 3D printer. Tool changing 3D printers use multiple hot-swappable extruder heads to allow them to print with multiple colors or materials. Jubilee is a great platform for experimental automation because the tool changing capability makes it possible to run multi-step experimental workflows on a single platform without moving samples manually. The open, extensible nature of the platform also makes it reasonably straightforward to develop new tools or capabilities. However, because Jubilee is an open-source system, the user is responsible for many aspects of building and running the system. This lends Jubilee a steep learning curve compared to other automation platforms. This guide provides a pathway to flatten that learning curve.

Because Jubilee is many things to many people, information on the platform is spread across several locations. 

- The Jubilee wiki page [https://jubilee3d.com/index.php?title=Main_Page](https://jubilee3d.com/index.php?title=Main_Page) is the official website of the Jubilee project. You will find instructions for [building the core motion platform](https://jubilee3d.com/index.php?title=Assembly_Instructions) and configuring it as a 3D printer here. 
- Jubilee as a 3D printer has a large and active community. The Jubilee discord is the best spot to interact with this community. 
- The people behind science-jubilee host an Open Source Lab Automation discord server. Join at [https://discord.gg/ubxU2rMJwN](https://discord.gg/ubxU2rMJwN).
