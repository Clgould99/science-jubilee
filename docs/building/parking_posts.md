# Setting parking post positions

Tool parking posts keep tools accessible but out of the way when they are not in use. Correctly setting parking post positions is critical to smooth, reliable tool changes with your Jubilee. The process of setting parking post positions involves determining and recording the X and Y positions of the parked tool, adjusting the Z height of the parking post, and configuring the appropriate tool change macro files. 


## Selecting an appropriate parking post for your tool

Jubilee tool parking posts come in various sizes to accommodate different tool sizes. If you are building an existing tool design from the `science-jubilee` project, the tool documentation should provide the correct parking post STL files. If you are building a new tool, you will need to either design your tool wing spacing around an existing parking post width, or modify the parking post design to fit your tool. [Parking post assembly instructions](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/blob/main/tools/jubilee_tools/tool_posts/configurable_tool_post/assembly_instructions/parking_post_assembly_instructions.pdf) are available at the main Jubilee project repository. [More parking post information](https://jubilee3d.com/index.php?title=Tools) can be found on the Jubilee project wiki.

## You will need

1. An assembled, configured Jubilee
2. A new tool to be parked
3. An appropriate parking post for your tool, assembled (see above)
4. 1.5mm and 2.5mm hex keys, either in an L-key or screwdriver format (exposed hex key shaft is required to reach recessed fasteners)

## Placing the parking post on Jubilee

1. Fasten your parking post loosely to the front top extrusion piece of your Jubilee. Use the T-nuts you inserted during assembly. If you ran out of T-nuts, you will need to use drop-in M5 T-nuts.
2. Position the parking post where you would like on the extrusion, and tighten the parking post base screws with your 2.5mm hex key. When placing your parking post, consider the spacing required between tools, the total number of tools you will have on your Jubilee, and any obstructions that may interfere with low-hanging tools like the front Z leadscrews.
