# Jubilee Build Resources

The Jubilee project has its own documentation and build resources. This page collates existing documentation to help you get started in building a Jubilee.

## General Jubilee Resources

- [Jubilee Wiki](https://jubilee3d.com/index.php?title=Main_Page). This is the main documentation hub for the Jubilee project. We encourage you to look through the resources organized on the left-hand sidebar--there's a lot of info there! While not all pages on the wiki will be relevant for lab automation, many help demonstrate Jubilee functionality.
- [Jubilee Discord](https://discord.gg/jubilee). The Jubilee Builders and Extenders Discord is actively used by the Jubilee Community. If you have a question about a build step or troubleshooting your machine, this is a great place to get help! Discussion is organized by topic--you may be interested in the `#lab-automation` channel, for example.

## Building your Jubilee

- [Jubilee Kit](https://www.filastruder.com/collections/jubilee/products/jubilee-motion-platform-kit). The parts to build a Jubilee have been consolidated into a kit which can be bought from Filastruder. (Note: We don't make any money off of this!).
- [Assembly Instructions](https://jubilee3d.com/index.php?title=Assembly_Instructions). There are assembly instructions for each step of the Jubilee build.
- [Build Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JUbr9aU8eQ). In addition to the pdf instructions, we created a series of videos which guide you through the build process.
