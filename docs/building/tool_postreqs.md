## Tool Parking Positions

After you build a tool, you'll need to set the exact location of the tool so it can be picked up.

- There is an overview of the process [here](https://jubilee3d.com/index.php?title=Setting_Tool_Parking_Positions) on the Jubilee Wiki.
- We have also created a Jupyter notebook tutorial (link not provided).

## Tool Offsets

Tools come in many shapes and sizes. To accommodate tools of different heights and prevent crashes with the bed plate, we need to set a Z offset. To make sure that the tip of each tool is aligned to one another, we also need to set an X-Y offset.

- We have also created a Jupyter notebook tutorial for setting XY offsets (link not provided).

## Duet Configuration

Each tool will need to be configured in softwareâ€”see individual tool documentation for more information.
