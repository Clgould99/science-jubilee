## Tool Parking Positions

After you build a tool, you'll need to set the exact location of the tool so it can be picked up. This process is detailed in the [parking posts documentation](parking_posts.md). There is also a [write-up on the Jubilee wiki](https://jubilee3d.com/index.php?title=Setting_Tool_Parking_Positions).


## Tool Offsets

Tools come in many shapes and sizes. To accommodate tools of different heights and prevent crashes with the bed plate, we need to set a Z offset. To make sure that the tip of each tool is aligned to one another, we also need to set an X-Y offset.

- This process is described in the new user guide [here](../getting_started/new_user_guide.md#setting-tool-parking-post-positions-and-offsets)
- There is an overview of the process [here](https://jubilee3d.com/index.php?title=Setting_Tool_Offsets) on the Jubilee Wiki.
- We have also created a Jupyter notebook tutorial for setting XY offsets (link not provided).

## Duet Configuration

Each tool will need to be configured in softwareâ€”see individual tool documentation for more information.
